* fix not-yet-updated configurations (FIXMEs in chainparams.cpp)

* add "getauxblock" + regtests

* soft fork in namecoind:
  - limit DB locks / unique tx
  - disallow greedy names
  - enforce nametx-version also for name *outputs*
  - update fee logic?

* decide about exact P2SH behaviour, implement it, add regtests for names

* upgrade to new version at fixed height:
  - blocks version=2 via majority rule soft fork (BIP34)
  - P2SH as enforced soft fork (BIP16)
  - strict BIP30 as enforced soft fork
  - allow larger blocks (DB locks)
  - name_new format change?
  - more differences???

* reenable some of the disabled tests, new alert keys?

* make dust spam unspendable?

* dropexpirednames=1 to also remove expired names from the name database?
