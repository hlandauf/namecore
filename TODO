* prevent name_new stealing in mempool

* test multisig/P2SH with names

* fix testnet and other not-yet-updated configurations / FIXMEs

* test CBlockVersion for being a standard-layout class

* merge-mining RPC calls

* soft fork in namecoind:
  - limit DB locks / unique tx
  - disallow greedy names
  - enforce nametx-version also for name *outputs*
  - what about 774d4c446cecfc40b1c02fdc5a13be6d2007233f9d91daefab6b3c2e70042f05?
    could this still happen?  why is it accepted in the code at all?

* upgrade to new version at fixed height:
  - blocks version=2 via majority rule soft fork (BIP34)
  - P2SH as enforced soft fork (BIP16)
  - strict BIP30 as enforced soft fork
  - allow larger blocks (DB locks)
  - name_new format change?
  - more differences???

* reenable some of the disabled tests, new alert keys?

* make dust spam unspendable?

* dropexpirednames=1 to also remove expired names from the name database?
